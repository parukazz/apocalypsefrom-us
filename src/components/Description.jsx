            Casuality, Everything happens for a reason. And it is up to the
            chosen one to bear the consequences. In the world, there are
            relationships that bring happiness and pain to each other. The
            moment we realize that we can&apos;t keep from tearing each other
            apart, we are writing to swallow out affection and say goodbye with
            a happy heart. BON VOYAGE.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giving our all as a choice for you. From us. Only “we” can end a
            story that started with “us”. Let&apos;s strip it all away and
            choose what&apos;s the best. Dreamcatcher, the only survivors,
            travels back to the beginning of time and brings forth the highs and
            lows of human nature. We know that emotions are pure, a gift from
            Mother Nature to humans. We say goodbye, as we burn like a flaming
            match.
